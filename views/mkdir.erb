<p>NAME<br />
 mkdir -- make directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS<br />
 mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION<br />
 The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modi-<br />
 fied by the current umask(2).</p>

<p> The options are as follows:</p>

<p> -m mode<br />
 Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the specified mode. The mode argument can be in any<br />
 of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command. If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters &#96;&#96;+''<br />
 and &#96;&#96;-'' are interpreted relative to an initial mode of &#96;&#96;a=rwx''.</p>

<p> -p Create intermediate directories as required. If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each operand<br />
 must already exist. On the other hand, with this option specified, no error will be reported if a directory given<br />
 as an operand already exists. Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as<br />
 modified by the current umask, plus write and search permission for the owner.</p>

<p> -v Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are created.</p>

<p> The user must have write permission in the parent directory.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS<br />
 The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO<br />
 rmdir(1)</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY<br />
 The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.</p>

<p>STANDARDS<br />
 The mkdir utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (&#96;&#96;POSIX.2'') compatible.</p>

<p>HISTORY<br />
 A mkdir command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>
