<p>NAME<br />
 touch -- change file access and modification times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS<br />
 touch [-A [-][[hh]mm]SS] [-acfhm] [-r file] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION<br />
 The touch utility sets the modification and access times of files. If any file does not exist, it is created with default<br />
 permissions.</p>

<p> By default, touch changes both modification and access times. The -a and -m flags may be used to select the access time or<br />
 the modification time individually. Selecting both is equivalent to the default. By default, the timestamps are set to<br />
 the current time. The -t flag explicitly specifies a different time, and the -r flag specifies to set the times those of<br />
 the specified file. The -A flag adjusts the values by a specified amount.</p>

<p> The following options are available:</p>

<p> -A Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by the specified value. This flag is intended for use<br />
 in modifying files with incorrectly set time stamps.</p>

<p> The argument is of the form &#96;&#96;[-][[hh]mm]SS'' where each pair of letters represents the following:</p>

<p> - Make the adjustment negative: the new time stamp is set to be before the old one.<br />
 hh The number of hours, from 00 to 99.<br />
 mm The number of minutes, from 00 to 59.<br />
 SS The number of seconds, from 00 to 59.</p>

<p> The -A flag implies the -c flag: if any file specified does not exist, it will be silently ignored.</p>

<p> -a Change the access time of the file. The modification time of the file is not changed unless the -m flag is also<br />
 specified.</p>

<p> -c Do not create the file if it does not exist. The touch utility does not treat this as an error. No error messages<br />
 are displayed and the exit value is not affected.</p>

<p> -f Attempt to force the update, even if the file permissions do not currently permit it.</p>

<p> -h If the file is a symbolic link, change the times of the link itself rather than the file that the link points to.<br />
 Note that -h implies -c and thus will not create any new files.</p>

<p> -m Change the modification time of the file. The access time of the file is not changed unless the -a flag is also<br />
 specified.</p>

<p> -r Use the access and modifications times from the specified file instead of the current time of day.</p>

<p> -t Change the access and modification times to the specified time instead of the current time of day. The argument is<br />
 of the form &#96;&#96;[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]'' where each pair of letters represents the following:</p>

<p> CC The first two digits of the year (the century).<br />
 YY The second two digits of the year. If &#96;&#96;YY'' is specified, but &#96;&#96;CC'' is not, a value for &#96;&#96;YY''<br />
 between 69 and 99 results in a &#96;&#96;CC'' value of 19. Otherwise, a &#96;&#96;CC'' value of 20 is used.<br />
 MM The month of the year, from 01 to 12.<br />
 DD the day of the month, from 01 to 31.<br />
 hh The hour of the day, from 00 to 23.<br />
 mm The minute of the hour, from 00 to 59.<br />
 SS The second of the minute, from 00 to 61.</p>

<p> If the &#96;&#96;CC'' and &#96;&#96;YY'' letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current year. If the &#96;&#96;SS''<br />
 letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS<br />
 The touch utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY<br />
 The obsolescent form of touch, where a time format is specified as the first argument, is supported. When no -r or -t<br />
 option is specified, there are at least two arguments, and the first argument is a string of digits either eight or ten<br />
 characters in length, the first argument is interpreted as a time specification of the form &#96;&#96;MMDDhhmm[YY]''.</p>

<p> The &#96;&#96;MM'', &#96;&#96;DD'', &#96;&#96;hh'' and &#96;&#96;mm'' letter pairs are treated as their counterparts specified to the -t option. If the<br />
 &#96;&#96;YY'' letter pair is in the range 39 to 99, the year is set to 1939 to 1999, otherwise, the year is set in the 21st cen-<br />
 tury.</p>

<p>STANDARDS<br />
 The touch utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2 (&#96;&#96;POSIX.2'') specification.</p>
